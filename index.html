                My name is Cody Tracey, and thank you for taking the time to view my <a class="page-links" href='portfolio.html'>portfolio</a>.
                I am originally from the Chicagoland area but moved to Nasvhille 4 years ago after graduating college.
                I attended Carthage College in Kenosha, WI where I double majored in Classical Studies and Religious Studies and was a part of a number of professional and social organizations such as:

                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>Theta Alpha Kappa </li>
                    <li>Eta Sigma Phi</li>
                    <li>Model United Nations</li>
                </ul>

            <p>   
                Currently I work as a project manager at a plastic printing company called Card Marketing Services (CMS). There I coordinate between the customer and internal teams to make sure that the project slows 
                smoothly and that it is delviered in a timely manner.

            <p>
                While working full time, I am also attending the Vanderbilt/Trilogy Education Full Stack Web Developing Bootcamp, and upon completion I am hoping to transition into working in the IT industry.  
                For any inquires please do not hesitate to <a class="page-links" href='contact.html'>contact</a> me!
